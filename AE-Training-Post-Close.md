# AE Training: After the Close
## SuperFunnel — Retention & Expansion Playbook

---

## 1. What You Just Sold

**SuperFunnel** is a 3-month paid pilot at **$5,000/month ($15,000 total).**

The ministry gets a co-branded acquisition funnel on PRAY.COM that:
- Attracts faith-intent iOS users via targeted ads
- Captures first-party data (name, email, location, giving intent)
- Runs automated discipleship + donor nudge sequences
- Converts users into premium subscribers, generating a revenue split back to the ministry

The pilot exists to **prove ROI, then scale.** Your job doesn't end at close — it starts there.

---

## 2. Your Role: Quarterback

| Role | Owns |
|---|---|
| **AE** | Client relationship, meeting cadence, expansion framing, final close |
| **Success (CSM)** | Onboarding in PRAYStudio, technical setup, client relationship maintenance |
| **Product** | Campaign execution, optimization, all data reports at every milestone |
| **Marketing** | Lead magnet, creative assets, campaign messaging |

> **You do not run campaigns. You do not pull data. You own the client narrative and drive toward expansion.**

---

## 3. The Deal Handoff — Do This Immediately

When a deal is **Closed Won**, the following must be true or the handoff breaks:

**Your checklist before you hand off:**
- [ ] Deal record in HubSpot: Deal Name, Deal Owner, Deal Type, Pipeline, Stage = Closed Won
- [ ] Leader Name field populated
- [ ] Closed Won Reason (dropdown) filled
- [ ] Short Term Goal + Long Term Goal filled
- [ ] Parent company associated with Segment, Domain, and Type populated
- [ ] At least one contact with email + job title
- [ ] Product line item includes: Category, Term, Billing Frequency, Service Start Date, Service End Date
- [ ] Signed quote with Product SKU + Quantity

When this is complete, automation handles the rest:
- Creates the **Leader record** in HubSpot
- Creates the **Onboarding Project** (target launch: Day 21, hard due date: Day 28)
- Notifies Slack and sends internal + external welcome emails
- Places the leader in the correct pipeline (see below)

---

## 4. Which Pipeline Does Your Client Land In?

| Situation | Pipeline |
|---|---|
| SuperFunnel **only** | **Pilot Pipeline** |
| SuperFunnel + any other PRAY product | **Ministry SaaS Pipeline** |

After the pilot ends:
- **Renews same contract** → stays on Pilot Pipeline
- **Expands with new products** → moves to Ministry SaaS Pipeline
- **Cancels** → mark cancellation date + reason, status = Churned

---

## 5. The 90-Day Milestone Map

This is the most important thing you need to know. Every milestone has a meeting, a data deliverable from Product, and a required booking for the next meeting.

```
Day 0      → Launch Confirmed (you send; Product gets green light)
Day 7-10   → Technical Onboarding (Success + Product confirm tracking live)
Day 15     → Early Signal Check (Success-led; first data snapshot from Product)
Day 30     → Momentum Review — CRITICAL (you + Success; full 30-day report from Product)
Day 60     → Expansion Framing — CRITICAL (you lead; scaling scenarios from Product)
Day 75     → Proposal Review — MANDATORY (you lead; full proposal tied to pilot data)
Day 90     → Final Decision — MANDATORY (you close)
```

**Rule: Every meeting ends with the next meeting booked. No exceptions.**

---

## 6. What Product Delivers at Each Milestone

You don't produce this data. Product does. Know what to expect so you can hold them accountable and use it in client conversations.

| Milestone | Product Delivers |
|---|---|
| Day 15 | Impressions, emails collected, early subscribers, CPE vs. benchmarks |
| Day 30 | Total investment, impressions, emails (CPE), subscribers (CPS), revenue, ELTR, benchmark comparison, scaling recommendation |
| Day 60 | Full 60-day metrics + 3 scaling scenarios: Conservative ($15K), Moderate ($30K), Aggressive ($50K+) with projected outcomes |
| Day 75 | ROI trajectory, subscriber retention, revenue per subscriber, data-backed pricing justification |
| Day 90 | Complete pilot summary, lessons learned, execution plan if expanded / post-mortem if declined |

---

## 7. Your Job at Each Stage

### Day 0 — Launch
- Send launch confirmation to client
- Book Tech Onboarding and Day 30 Review immediately

### Day 15 — Early Signal
- Be aware; Success leads this call
- Review Product's snapshot before the call
- Address friction points fast

### Day 30 — Momentum Review
- You co-lead with Success
- Review the one-page momentum snapshot
- **Book Day 60 on this call — non-negotiable**

### Day 60 — Expansion Framing
- **You lead this call**
- Use Product's 60-day report + 3 scaling scenarios
- Leave the call with: expansion direction, verbal alignment on tier/scope, budget range confirmed
- **Book Day 75 on this call — mandatory**

### Day 75 — Proposal Review
- **You lead this call**
- Present full expansion proposal tied to pilot data
- Handle objections
- **Book Day 90 on this call — mandatory**

### Day 90 — Final Decision
- **You close**
- Outcome is one of three: ✓ Expansion signed / ✓ Clear decline / ✓ Executive escalation
- If declined: document reason, notify leadership, Product runs post-mortem

---

## 8. Pre-Launch Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

Product **cannot start campaign execution** until ALL of the following are complete:

- [ ] Success: Client onboarded in PRAYStudio
- [ ] Success: Subs+ / donation infrastructure configured
- [ ] Marketing: Lead magnet setup complete
- [ ] Marketing: Creative assets delivered to Product
- [ ] AE: Contract signed + first meeting scheduled

If setup is stalled, escalate immediately. A late launch compresses the 90-day window.

---

## 9. Expansion Path — What You're Building Toward

The pilot benchmark is **$100K in donor revenue in the first 30 days.** That's the proof point.

**Pilot → Expansion tiers:**

| Tier | Monthly Spend |
|---|---|
| Growth Starter | $2,000/mo |
| Impact Pro | $5,000–6,000/mo |
| Kingdom Enterprise | $8,000–10,000+/mo (custom) |

The Jack Graham case study: 4,000+ emails and 50+ subscribers in 30 days → scaled to a year-long agreement at ~$250K annually. That's the model. Use it.

**By Day 60, expansion direction must be aligned.** If you're not having that conversation, you're behind.

---

## 10. Key Operating Rules

1. **AE = Quarterback** — you own the client from close to expansion
2. **Product = Autonomous Operator** — they can start, pause, scale campaigns without your approval; they cannot skip data deliverables
3. **Every meeting ends with the next meeting booked**
4. **Data is not siloed** — Product delivers to all stakeholders; you should always know the numbers before the client does
5. **Expansion direction aligned by Day 60, proposal reviewed by Day 75, decision by Day 90**
6. **If Product identifies campaign issues** → they optimize first, then notify you → you decide if client needs to hear it

---

## 11. Escalation

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Campaign underperforming | Product adjusts tactically → notifies AE + Success → AE decides client comms |
| Expansion at risk (Day 60+) | Product provides supporting data → AE owns the conversation → leadership escalation if needed |
| Pre-launch stalled | AE escalates immediately; every day late is a day lost in the 90-day window |

---
